what is control flow?
 -- the execution of code in a controlled manner

 sequence of our code - structure of our js document
 - top to bottom

 branching - logic / conditional statement
     if else statements

looping - repeat a set of instructions for a finite count
    for while
    for loop - for loop for president
    while - trickier - run/ execute code until some condition is false
     - make sure loop can close

conditionals - if else - conditional operators - ternary statements
loops - for loops / whiles / array methods (array iterators) /
functions - execute blocks of code in a controlled manner
